## System Setup

How to create this from Scratch, you need node >= 8 so that  
the package-lock.json file will be used.
If you don't want to change you currently installed version,  
consider using nvm so you can have multiple versions.

```bash
nvm install latest 64
nvm on
nvm install 6.11.1 64
npm -v
nvm use 6.11.1
npm -v
nvm use 8.2.1

npm init
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -D
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g --save

npm ls --json --depth=0
```

For me `npm ls --json --depth=0` output looks like this.

```json
{
  "name": "webpacktutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "webpack": {
      "version": "3.4.1",
      "from": "webpack",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-3.4.1.tgz"
    },
    "webpack-dev-server": {
      "version": "2.6.1",
      "from": "webpack-dev-server",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack-dev-server/-/webpack-dev-server-2.6.1.tgz"
    }
  }
}
```

And encase it turns out to matter these are my installed global dependencies
run this command to see what yours are > npm ls -g --json --depth=0

```json

    }
  }
}

## Example1) Bundle Javascript

```bash
npm run example1
```

This npm script will run the following two commands  
webpack --config=webpack.example1.js  
webpack-dev-server --config=webpack.example1.js --open  

* Note: While the webpack-dev-server does host your files, with this simple setup you will have to restart the dev server in order to see your file changes. The reason is that it recompiles in memory and doesn't write the file changes to disk, and your html page isn't pointing at it's in memory compile, but instead it points to the bundle.js file on the disk. The workaround would be to run "webpack --watch" in one console, and webpack-dev-server in a second console, at which point it would have been better to use a basic node express server with webpack in watch mode.

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example2) Add index.html to bundle

For this example I removed the script tag from the html  
and added the html-webpack-plugin to the project

```bash
npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
npm run example2
```

- Notice it is automatically adding a script tag for bundle.js to the index.html in your dist folder.

- Now when you edit either a js file or the index.html file, webpack-dev-server recompiles the modified modules, and refreshes the browser, no stopping compiling and restarting. This feature is functionally similar to the popular Browser-Sync package.

- Notice if you right click and view source, index.html is not loading content from your dist folder. It is now loading webpack-dev-server in memory compiled file. ðŸ˜Š

## Example3) Add typescript transpile to build

In this example we are going to switch our js files to ts files.

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
npm install typescript -g
npm install awesome-typescript-loader --save-dev
tsc init
```

* Note: Using windows 10, npm, and nvm, you might have to run "nvm on" at least once in your console or get a permission error when running npm install. I got the error "Please try running this command again as root/Administrator." error when installing typescript even if the console is already running as administrator Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example4) Code reusability

```bash
npm run example4
```

For this example, on each page we want to show a users display name.  
And we need to use this method to decide how to render their display name.

```typescript
    public getDisplayName = () =>{
        if(this.UserType == UserType.Doctor){
            return `${this.LastName}, ${this.FirstName}, MD`
        }
        if(this.UserType == UserType.Nurse){
            return `${this.LastName}, ${this.FirstName}, RN`
        }
        if(this.UserType == UserType.Patient){
            return `${this.LastName}, ${this.FirstName}`
        }
        return `${this.LastName}, ${this.FirstName}`
    }
```

We don't want to have a copy of this code on every page. If the logic changes it increases the chance that we will fail to update the code somewhere, and adds complexity. If you look at the code in Example4 you can see that we are importing user, which is allowing us to share the same getDisplayName method on all pages.  

You will also notice that I am importing the AddTextToHtml function, using typescript, and **without webpack**, or requirejs, or something similar I would not have been able to reuse this function but would have had to have a copy of it on every page.

### Why a module loader, or bundler is required

try running `npm run example4b` and take a look at src/example4/tscBundle.js if you were to paste it into a browser console you would get the following error. `VM109:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: define is not defined at <anonymous>:1:1` This is because typescript wrapped up each file as an AMD module, and browsers don't have built in module loaders (yet).

If you tell typescript **not** to wrap it up as a module then you get this error.

```bash
tsc -p ./tsconfigs/tsconfig.example4b.json --module none
src/example4/shared/user.ts(1,13): error TS1148: Cannot use
imports, exports, or module augmentations when '--module' is 'none'.
```

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example5) Multiple entry points

In this example I've added 2 new things to our webpack config  

```js
const webpack = require( 'webpack' );
```

and

```js
new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
    name: 'shared',
    filename: 'shared.js',
    minChunks: (module) => {
        return module.context && module.context.indexOf("shared") !== -1;
    }
})
```  

[commons-chunk-plugin documentation](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/)

This is going to allow us to move all the code shared by our entry points into a separate shared bundle. The module.context you see in the function is the absolute path to the folder of each file. The function specified in the minChunks property tests if the file is under the shared folder. When the function returns true it moves the module into the shared bundle.

- Try running "webpack --config=webpack.example5.js" and look at the output in the dist folder.

- Also take note of the entry points in our webpack config.

```js
//...
module.exports = {
    entry: {
        app:'./example5/app.ts',
        page1: './example5/page1/page1.ts',
        page2: './example5/page2/page2.ts'
    },
//...
```

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

### Entry Points, what are they and how do they work

An entry point is a file or an array of files that after having gathered all dependencies should be bundled into a "[Chunk](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html#chunk-types)"

- If you look at the source code in example5 you can see that this isn't a SPA application, but rather it is a classic website in that each page is a separate html file running separate js. As a result these 3 files are fully isolated other than that they all use the files in the shared directory.
- The app.ts file doesn't import page1.ts, or page2.ts, and vice versa.
- When webpack builds the [Dependency Graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) it looks for anything that is a url, whether it is an import/require statement, or image/file path and uses all of them to then generate a "chunk". Because app.ts/page1.ts/page2.ts aren't in each others dependency tree using any one of them as a single entry point would fail to build/bundle all of your source code. Their are 2.5 ways to solve this.
  1. As in example5 you can have multiple entry points, webpack will walk each file tree separately, and you can then use the [CommonsChunkPlugin](http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#commonschunkplugin) to pull shared resources into a common/sharable [Normal Chunk](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html#normal-chunk). Without the CommonsChunkPlugin the shared code would be duplicated for each each [Entry Chunk](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html#entry-chunk).
  1. You can use an array of files as your entry point. This would be my first choice in a SPA application
  1. For more complex websites do both. Have multiple entry points some or all of which are arrays of files.

Look for more about arrays as entry points in [Example6](#example6-using-a-file-array-as-an-entry-point).

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example6) Using a file array as a single entry point

```js
//...

const glob = require("glob");

const buildfiles = glob.sync("./example6/**/*.ts")

module.exports = {
    entry: {
        app:buildfiles
    },
//...
```

In this example we use node's file glob module to find all the ts files and then use them all as our entry point. This creates a single app bundle minus the shared code which we are still extracting into a separate bundle.

The **big advantage** here is that we don't need to manually manage our entry points by hand anymore.
If I add a new file to the project it will get picked up automatically with no need to modify the build process.

------------------------
[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

### File loading issues not solved by using a globbed file array

Their are still two scenarios where you can get script loading and load order issues even though you are using typescript and webpack.

- If you are accessing a global/ambient variable and you expect it to be in a certain state, but you haven't included the import of the file that would have put it in the desired state.
  - Example1: In angularjs if you try to add a service to a module by calling something like this.  
  `angular.module('app').service('MyApiCaller',MyApiCaller)`
  It expects the module to have been initialized, but it references it via a string and not an object reference; as a result typescript doesn't realize the object is undefined. **You can fix this one of 2 ways**.
    - (best option) You can import your app.module in the `MyApiCaller` service. Every file should be importing all of it's dependencies so this would be the modern approach.
    - You can have one master index.ts file that imports all of your files in the correct order (like we use to have to do with script tags in html files) and use it as your entry point
  - Example2: Angular routes you to a component but you didn't import the component in your `app.routes.ts`, or `app.module.ts` file. Typescript only warns you when you use an object you haven't imported, it doesn't know at what point angular is going to recognize your custom html element as being a thing, and an ng-controller attribute isn't a url so webpack's [Dependency Graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) magic isn't going to factor in here either.
    - Have `app.routes.ts` import anything that it routes to.
    - Keep in mind angularjs [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) handles in-memory dependencies and webpack handles file dependencies

- If you are using a framework that checks/modifies global/window variables.
  - Example: Angular checks to see if window.jQuery exists and then decides whether or not to use it's own jqlite. Webpack protects the global name space by wrapping each module in an [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression) which is great and avoids collisions, but means it won't see your imported jquery when it checks window for jQuery. Their is a simple solution, use webpack.ProvidePlugin this rewrites the usages of the global with with the imported reference

```js
//ProvidePlugin Automatically loads modules. Whenever the identifier is encountered as free variable in a module, the module is loaded automatically and the identifier is filled with the exports of the loaded module.
new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    $: "jquery",
    jQuery: "jquery",
    'window.jQuery':"jquery"
}),
```

------------------------
[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example7) Add css to your build process

First thing, we are going to add two new packages css-loader, and style-loader  
`npm i -D css-loader`  
`npm i -D style-loader`

next we would add this to the webpack module rules

```js
{
    test: /\.(css)$/,
    use: [
        { loader: "style-loader" },
        { loader: "css-loader" }
    ]
},
```

We will also need to do something so that the css files showup in our entry point's [Dependency Graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/). You have at least 3 options at this point.

1. (my choice) In each pages ts file import the required css. `import './page1.css'` 
1. Use one file as an index of all your css, and import it their.
1. Use a file glob to find all your css and add it as an entry point.

Webpack passes the output up the array of loaders. So when webpack is processing a css file, given our config, [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) will process the css file first, and then [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) processes the output of css-loader. css-loader handles the webpack [Dependency Graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) of your css files, and style-loader adds CSS to the DOM by injecting a style tag

```bash
npm run example7
```

You may notice that in your dist file you don't see any css files.
style-loader uses javascript to add your styles to the DOM. With sytle-loader our app.js file is **20.8KB** without it, app.js is **6KB**. With more complex sites I have seen the overhead of using sytle-loader as large as 80KB.

To avoid this lets try solving it another way. Lets use the [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin)

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example7b) Making css output smaller via the ExtractTextPlugin

I've added a new plugin, `npm i -D extract-text-webpack-plugin` and some config.

```js
{
    test: /\.(css)$/,
    use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({
        use: [
            {loader: 'css-loader'}
        ]
    })
},
```

Run this command

```bash
npm run example7b
```

As you can see this file size is much better. Our app.js file is **2.8KB**, and style.css is **148bytes**, and extract-text-webpack-plugin has added a link tag for style.css to our html. Run `npm run example7:build` to compare file sizes.

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example8) Adding scss transpiling to the build

For example 8 I've added `npm i -D sass-loader` and also `npm i -D node-sass` then I changed all the css files to scss files. I have also added an h2 tag to all 3 pages, and I put the style for h2's in the app.scss file.

```js
{
    test: /\.(css|scss)$/,
    use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({
        use: [
            {loader: 'css-loader'},
            {
                loader: "sass-loader",
                options: {
                    includePaths: [
                        path.resolve(__dirname, './node_modules'),
                        path.resolve(__dirname, './example8')
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    })
}
```

If run `npm run example8` you will see that like before we get a single style.css file output, but you may notice that the h2 style rule is duplicated.

```css
h2 {
  background-color: black;
  color: red; }

#IndexHeader {
  background-color: #1E90FF; }
h2 {
  background-color: black;
  color: red; }

#PageOneHeader {
  background-color: #8FBC8F; }
h2 {
  background-color: black;
  color: red; }

#PageTwoHeader {
  background-color: #00FFFF; }
```

For details on why this happened read [scss common misunderstanding](#scss-common-misunderstanding), and how to solve for this in [Example9](#example9-how-to-prevent-duplicate-code-in-your-scss-bundles-output)

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

### Scss common misunderstanding

While typescript, and webpack imports behave in one manner, scss imports have some subtle differences that often lead to duplication in the bundle. If I were to compare them to telephones, a javascript import/require would be like asking for my phone number, and an scss @import is like asking for my actual phone. @import does a literal copy past. If your goal is to have the smallest bundle possible and to avoid transmitting the same code twice, we are going to need to use scss [Partials](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4), and an single app/main.scss file which imports all the partials.

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Example9) How to prevent duplicate code in your Scss bundle output

```bash
npm run example9
```

Instead of importing app.scss into each pages scss file like in example8, in this example I have inverted the imports. By removing the css import of each pages ts file e.g. `import './page1.scss'`, and removing the `@import '../app'` from each page's individual scss file, and moving all the `@import` statements into the app.scss file, I have given node-sass one central location in which it can copy and paste all the css together. The last step was to prefix each pages scss file name with an `_` this tells sass that the file is a [Partial](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4). Technically because we are using webpack the `_` may not be required, but if you were to use Sass compiler by itself it would generate one css file per scss file not prefixed with an `_` and it feels safer to me to follow their compiler conventions.

Taking a look at the output you can see we now have no more duplication

```css
#IndexHeader {
  background-color: #1E90FF; }

#PageOneHeader {
  background-color: #8FBC8F; }

#PageTwoHeader {
  background-color: #00FFFF; }

h2 {
  background-color: black;
  color: red; }
```

## Why everyone needs file hashing

Browsers cache site content aka your Html, Images, Css, and Javascript. For every production deployment of your site you are going to want the end user to be downloading running and viewing the new/changed content, and not displaying/executing their cached old copy of your site. Getting browsers to recognize that a file has changed can be very complex. Their are lots of partial solutions, and its easy to get it only partially right. Accidentally solving the problem for Chrome, but finding the solution is slightly different in IE etc. etc.

Their is **one** sure fire browser agnostic way to guarantee that the browser immediately downloads new content while preserving unchanged content for as long as possible...

**Change the file name when the content of the file changes!**

This is a completely unreasonable thing to do by hand, but simple to do with webpack. It can use a hash of the file content when outputting your build files, and rewrite all your URLs to point at the new dynamically generated file name.
If you have ever been involved in the second deployment of a site written by new web developers you will probably understand why this excites me.

[back to beginning](#webpack-tutorial)

## Understanding how webpack hashing works

### Example10a

run this command `npm run example10a` notice all the files have the same hash. change anything in any of your bundled files and the hash of all your files change.
This would be effective at cache busting, but may cause a degraded user experience if you have a large website since they will have to download all your content after every deployment.

### Example10b

run this command `npm run example10b` and notice that each chunk has it's own hash. At first glance you might assume you have arrived at the desired outcome, but let's test that theory.

Go and modify MiscSecondEntryPoint.ts, change the `console.log` statement on line 6 and then run `npm run example10b` again, and notice only [id]-misc-[chunkhash].js has changed, so far so good.

Now go to line 4 in page1.ts, and change one character and run `npm run example10b` again.

- Notice, your app.js, shared.js, and app.css hashes have all changed. This is a side effect of the webpack manifest, and that before running CommonsChunkPlugin, and the ExtractTextPlugin they all started out part of the "app" entry point.

### Example10c

Run the command `npm run example10c` and take a look at the dist folder. It's not perfect but this is the first configuration that meets our goal of independent file hashes.

I've added another instance of the CommonsChunkPlugin.
The first instance processes the app entry point and creates a shared chunk, and the second instance processes the new shared chunk. The reason for this second instance is that the last instance to run gets stuck with this line of code in the webpack header code block.

```js
/******/ script.src = __webpack_require__.p + "" + chunkId + "-" + chunkId + "-" + {"0":"c5cc4a4ec9b4b9fdaa02","1":"5dd341c1d664643bd52e"}[chunkId] + ".js";
```

This line contains the file hashes from the main app entry point, and the hash of the now extracted shared chunk. If we leave it in the shared chunk then the contents of the shared file changes when ever the app chunk's hash changes.

- Note: keep in mind that the shared code example is a little contrived. In our finished config we are going to be using this same method to extract vendor files imported from node_modules into a separate bundle and that keeping the vendor file hash static may save the client from having to wait while they download MB's of code they already had cached.

Now go to line 4 in page1.ts, and change one character and run `npm run example10c` again. You will see 2 file names change. your app.js file, and your manifest.js file, while we are forcing them to download 1 extra 5.86 kB file, we are choosing to do that rather than a theoretical 10MB vendor file.

### Example10d The Ideal Hashing Solution

Run the command `npm run example10d` and take a look at the dist folder. Modify any one file, and only the bundle file containing the modified code will get a new hash value also; no functionless js files just to hold the webpack manifest, and no empty js files left behind by the extract text plugin. The client can cache the content files forever and we aren't going to run into any caching problems.

The ExtractTextPlugin uses contenthash so that the **css** files hash is unaffected by changes in js.  
The **app.js** code is hashed after the css is extracted so that css changes don't change your app.js hash.  
The WebpackMd5Hash plugin together with the InlineChunkManifestHtmlWebpackPlugin protect the **shared.js** from changes in the app.js bundle code.
